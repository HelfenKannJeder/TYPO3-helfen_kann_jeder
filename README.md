# HelfenKannJeder TYPO3 Extension
This is the main part of the German website HelfenKannJeder.de. The goal of the project is recruiting of volunteer people to civil protection organizations.

Basically HelfenKannJeder has three main functions for consumers:
* Skill testing of interested persons with mapping to a civil protection organization.
* Showing all civil protection organizations in a map.
* List of all organizations.

For civil protection organizations there exists the possibility to register their organization. Heads clustered around the organizations can prove the registrations and accept them.
